**# Aptamer_Design **
This study explores the potential of AI and machine learning in designing aptamers for targeted drug delivery and diagnostics in healthcare. Aptamers are single-stranded oligomers that can specifically bind to targets, playing vital roles in drug discovery, bioimaging, and precision medicine.
**Key Features:**
Objective: Optimize aptamers for enhanced stability, binding affinity, and therapeutic applications.
Approaches: ML/AI based tools for virtual screeening and binding afinity prediction
Applications: Cancer treatment, infectious diseases, precision medicine, and targeted therapies.

â€”We have utlized some already existed machine learning and deep learning based tools to prepare a novel pipeline to design new modified aptamers.

  ##### Case Study results
  1- Aptamer library generation : 16384 sequnces have been generated of 3HSB RNA aptamer sequence 'AGAGAGA'.
  2- Virtual screening: AptaNet has been used for virtual screening. 
     (a) Features extraction and prediction: Features has been extracted on the basis of interaction features such as AAX 9Amino acid composition), k-3mer, PseAAC (Pseudo Amino Acid Composition)  
                                                           will be extracted. ces having Class 1 and highest interaction probability percentage will be selected for CHIMERA_NA mutation.
     (b)
