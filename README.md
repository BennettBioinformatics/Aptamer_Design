**# Aptamer_Design **
This study explores the potential of AI and machine learning in designing aptamers for targeted drug delivery and diagnostics in healthcare. Aptamers are single-stranded oligomers that can specifically bind to targets, playing vital roles in drug discovery, bioimaging, and precision medicine.
**Key Features:**
Objective: Optimize aptamers for enhanced stability, binding affinity, and therapeutic applications.
Approaches: ML/AI based tools for virtual screeening and binding afinity prediction
Applications: Cancer treatment, infectious diseases, precision medicine, and targeted therapies.

â€”We have utlized some already existed machine learning and deep learning based tools to prepare a novel pipeline to design new modified aptamers.
